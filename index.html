    <h1>The Great Exam Heist</h1>

    <h2>Chapter 1: The Unlikely Heroes</h2>
    <p>In the small town of Mirpur, Dhaka, lived a group of friends known for their quirky personalities and bizarre adventures. There was <b>Rafiq</b>, the tech genius who could hack into any system; <i>Shumi</i>, the journalist with a knack for exaggeration; and <u>Tanvir</u>, the perpetually confused yet well-meaning friend. One fateful evening, as they gathered at their favorite tea stall, they found themselves in the middle of a situation that would turn their world upside down.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 2: The Accidental Leak</h2>
    <p>It all started when Rafiq received an email with an attachment titled <mark>"BCS Exam Questions - Confidential"</mark>. Thinking it was a joke from a friend, he opened it and shared it with Shumi and Tanvir. Little did they know, this was the actual question paper for the upcoming BCS exam! Within minutes, Shumi, always looking for a scoop, posted a snippet on her blog, and the internet exploded.</p>

    <h2>Chapter 3: Media Frenzy</h2>
    <p>The next morning, the town was abuzz with the news of the leaked exam paper. Every news website was covering the scandal, and Shumi's blog had gone viral. As the trio watched the chaos unfold, they realized the gravity of their mistake.</p>
